Behavior of Running Applications When Secrets Are Updated

When you update a Kubernetes secret, the behavior of running applications depends on how the secret is being consumed:
1. Environment Variables (Static Injection)

Behavior: Applications continue using old values

    Environment variables are injected once at pod startup

    Updating the secret has no effect on already running pods

    New pods will receive the updated values

Example:
yaml

env:
- name: DB_PASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: db-secret
      key: password

Solution: You must restart/recreate pods to pick up new values
2. Volume Mounts (Files)

Behavior: Applications may see updates after some delay

    Secrets mounted as files are automatically updated

    The update delay is typically within the kubelet sync period (default 1 minute)

    Applications must actively watch/re-read the files to see changes

Example:
yaml

volumes:
- name: secret-volume
  secret:
    secretName: db-secret
volumeMounts:
- name: secret-volume
  mountPath: "/etc/secrets"

Solution Patterns:

    Application-level reloading: Implement file watching in your app

    Sidecar watcher: Use a sidecar container that signals the main app

    Pod restart: Simple but causes downtime

3. Projected Volumes with Refresh

Behavior: Similar to volume mounts but with more control
yaml

volumes:
- name: secrets
  projected:
    sources:
    - secret:
        name: db-secret
        items:
        - key: password
          path: db_password

4. External Solutions (Vault, etc.)

Behavior: Depends on implementation:

    Vault Agent: Can automatically renew/rotate secrets

    CSI Secrets Store: Can be configured to sync updates

    External Secrets Operator: Can watch for changes
