The worker processes setting in Nginx is a crucial performance parameter that determines how many worker processes Nginx will spawn to handle incoming requests.

worker_processes: auto - nginx will automaticly set number of worker processes equal to number of CPU cores available

optimal setting here number of cpu cores (check with nproc or lscpu in Linux)

but if you have cpu intensive workloads like ssl/tls processing you can set 1.5-2x number of cores

in kubernetes containers  when you set request and limits 
worker_processes:auto is not good because nginx will chose number of 
cores setted in  request/limits not in you node so better set it manually
