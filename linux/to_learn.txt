htop:
tasks: number of all tasks 
thr: threads
running:  how many tasks really is running, not sleeping
RES:  memory usage

Inode:
Structure  that describe  metadata of file,
All files have inode
too see  how much inodes is used:
df -i
By default linux creating  create  inode for every file  that weight more than 4kb.
Hard link:
to create link : ln file name_of_link
if you create hard link , file and link will have the same inode number

Swap:
Paging  -  Linux  distribute  ram data on pages. one page 4kb
Swaping - coping pages from ram to disk(swap space) when exist lack of memory.  
swap file:
sudo swapon -s
Dissadvantages:
Bigger latency.System first copy data from disk to ram.
High Disk usage. You can kill your ssd/hdd disk using this mechanic.


nice:



size of files: du -hs directory or file


cron:
to add cron job  "crontab -e"



backup:
to backup  directory:  tar -czvf backup.tar.gz  path_to_directory
to extract from backup directory:  tar -xf  backup.tar.gz
and with rsync
aws s3 sync


ssh paswordless connection:
1. Generation ssh key pair : ssh-keygen 
2.  Copy this pair   to remote server: ssh-copy-id
