load_avarage means how many proccesses in system waiting

key takeways:

if load avarage  less than  amount of cpu cores, system is not overloaded 



    If load average = 1.0 on a single-core CPU:

        The CPU is fully utilized (1 process running, 0 waiting).

    If load average > 1.0:

        Processes are waiting for CPU time (possible slowdown).

    If load average < 1.0:

        The CPU has idle time.

Typically load avarage showed in consistency of 3 values:
load average: 1.27, 2.06, 2.68
this consistency means:  1, 5, and 15 minutes.
