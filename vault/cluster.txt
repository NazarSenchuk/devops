When you create cluster  , you need to create  , unseal and login first node , that will be first leader of cluster.
Leader  - active  -> Handles all requests 
Folower - standby  -> redirect all requests to  active (if enterprise  read available)
If your leader is  down  , your  followers which have voter status  ,participate in  leader  election. 

to setup cluster:
simple example: 

leader configuration:

api_addr                = "http://vault:8200"
cluster_addr            = "http://vault:8201"
cluster_name            = "learn-vault-cluster"
disable_mlock           = true
ui                      = true

listener "tcp" {
address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
tls_disable = true
}

backend "raft" {
path    = "/vault/data"
node_id = "vault-leader"
}



folowers configurations:
api_addr                = "http://vault1:8200"
cluster_addr            = "http://vault1:8201"
cluster_name            = "learn-vault-cluster"
disable_mlock           = true
ui                      = true

listener "tcp" {
address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
tls_disable = true
}

backend "raft" {
path    = "/vault/data/folower1"
node_id = "vault-follower"

retry_join{
  leader_api_addr = "http://vault:8200"
}
}


main issues:
Error initializing storage of type raft: failed to create fsm: failed to open bolt file: open /data/vault.db: ped 
solution: vault can't access to create files  , maybe this directory used by another vault node 
local node not active but active cluster node not found
solution: check ip configurations
Preventing server addition that would require removal of too many servers and cause cluster instability
solution: set dns names instead of ip for you vault folowers.
